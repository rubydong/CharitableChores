# Charitable Chores
Charitable Chores is a project made for YHack 2016 by a group of three enthusiastic students from Stony Brook University. As college students ourselves, we wanted to find a solution on how to budget our money better. What better way to save money than by earning money? Our mobile app connects those who need assistance with their daily routines and individuals in need of extra finances. We have a charity aspect in which organizations can donate funds to incentivize people to perform good deeds. In one scenario, an organization can set allot money for helping out at the soup kitchen. The people who claim this opportunity will receive a fair amount, so that they are encouraged by the act not the amount of money. Furthermore, users of the app can also complete tasks for each other and pay each other accordingly. Lastly, our project doubles up as a budgetting app which helps the user set a goal and shows their progress in reaching that goal.
